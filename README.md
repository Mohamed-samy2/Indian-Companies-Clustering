# Indian Companies Clustering
 The objective of this project is to develop a robust clustering algorithm that categorizes companies into distinct groups based on shared features and characteristics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover underlying patterns and relationships within a diverse dataset of companies. This clustering approach will enable a more nuanced understanding of the business landscape, allowing stakeholders to identify commonalities and differences among companies. The resulting clusters can serve as valuable insights for strategic decision-making, targeted marketing, and tailored business strategies. Ultimately, this project seeks to unlock meaningful patterns in company data, facilitating a more insightful and data-driven approach to understanding and classifyingÂ businesses."
